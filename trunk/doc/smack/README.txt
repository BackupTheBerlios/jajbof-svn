   About the Distribution

   The smack.jar file in the main distribution folder is the only binary file
   required for embedding XMPP functionality into client applications. The
   optional smackx.jar contains the Smack extensions while smackx-debug.jar
   contains an enhanced debugger.

   If you downloaded the developer release, the full source of the library is
   included in the source directory and can be compiled using the build
   scripts found in the build directory (please see the README file in the
   build directory for further details).
